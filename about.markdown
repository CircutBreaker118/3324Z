<h1> About Us: </h1>

  We are a kids robotics group who started our journey in robotics in 6th grade. We are currently
  in 6th grade and compete in RECF robotics competition. One of our greatest achievements so far is
  reaching the 2025 California Middle School Regional Championship. We had lots of fun and learned several new things.

<h2> Goals: </h2>
  Our mission is to have fun and new learn things as we go along. We also want to win competitions
  and qualify to worlds in 7th grade as it is something that we want to accomplish.
